# Machine-Failure-Prediction
There might be different kind of failures in the machines based on the conditions under which they are working. Here I used different supervised machine learning classification algorithms to predict the type of failures based on the conditions under which machine is working.
Model which is built upon KNN algorithm gives me the best accuracy which is 98.8%
